# Starter Web Repo

This repository is for showing how Git and GitHub work and a great rebasing example. Now we're making some changes on the "myfeature" branch.

## Purpose

Sample website with plenty of files for demos or anything else you want

##Deployment

Just throwing some random text around. One more little change and then we're done.

## What is ".md"

"md" stands for "mark down" and is a glorified text file
